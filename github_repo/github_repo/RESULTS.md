- **AdamSN**: O(min(n,m)) - ~50% memory reduction
- **Adafactor**: O(n+m) - ~50% memory reduction

## Generated Text Samples

### Adam (Baseline)
```
I but siff, I will to my'll flord againsts,
And the have to sorse him bliry his thou;
GRIOLANUD: Have, shir, Take it marrioush see the all in a spice taper,
miner povers him thine to call as it my lord speak's't.
Thou know'st the hour, the word, the thing, the fate:
And if thou stand with men of mineâ€”thou art the state.
```

### AdamSN (Improved)
```

Whell thee ard, ithoodon ure, se inoapend.

### Adafactor
```

Freshing Your for faule: Citilf tor than you, not neme your down way.
LEOUCKIO: Herseal, my heser: A their thou grees oper a bay leath,
There, the all in deid, bother, missbearve our fie,
And now, good night, sweet hearts, the world shall know us fair.

## Key Insights

1. **Adafactor** achieves the best validation performance (1.9338) with strong coherence and 50% memory reduction
2. **Adam** remains a stable baseline (1.9353)
3. **AdamSN (Improved)** shows significant improvement over the original, achieving 50% memory reduction with much better convergence
4. All optimizers successfully generate coherent Shakespeare-style text
5. Memory-reduced optimizers provide viable alternatives for memory-constrained scenarios
